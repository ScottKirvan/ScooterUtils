OL2Cal - TODO
====
Just a spot to keep track of what's being worked on, what may get worked on next, and  what's been done.  

This is not a formal roadmap, or even a prioritized list, just a shorthand to help keep things on track.

TODO
----
- [ ] get project package'able for the unreal marketplace
- [ ] update documentation with better installation instructions since UE5 is more restrictive on where you install plugins.  See issue [#14](https://github.com/ScottKirvan/ScooterUtils/issues/14)
- [ ] Look into persisting some viewport settins [#13](https://github.com/ScottKirvan/ScooterUtils/issues/13) [#12](https://github.com/ScottKirvan/ScooterUtils/issues/12) [#11](https://github.com/ScottKirvan/ScooterUtils/issues/11)

In Progress
